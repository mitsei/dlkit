    A ``Resource`` is an arbitrary entity that may represent a person,
    place or thing used to identify an object used in various services.

    This lookup session defines several views:

      * comparative view: elements may be silently omitted or re-ordered
      * plenary view: provides a complete result set or is an error
        condition
      * isolated bin view: All resource methods in this session operate,
        retrieve and pertain to resources defined explicitly in the
        current bin. Using an isolated view is useful for managing
        ``Resources`` with the ``ResourceAdminSession.``
      * federated bin view: All resource methods in this session
        operate, retrieve and pertain to all resources defined in this
        bin and any other resources implicitly available in this bin
        through bin inheritence.


    The methods ``use_federated_bin_view()`` and
    ``use_isolated_bin_view()`` behave as a radio group and one should
    be selected before invoking any lookup methods.

    Resources may have an additional records indicated by their
    respective record types. The record may not be accessed through a
    cast of the ``Resource``.
