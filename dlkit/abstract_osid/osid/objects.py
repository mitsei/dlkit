class OsidObject:
    """``OsidObject`` is the top level interface for all OSID Objects.

    An OSID Object is an object identified by an OSID ``Id`` and may
    implements optional interfaces. OSID Objects also contain a display
    name and a description. These fields are required but may be used
    for a variety of purposes ranging from a primary name and
    description of the object to a more user friendly display of various
    attributes.

    Creation of OSID Objects and the modification of their data is
    managed through the associated ``OsidSession`` which removes the
    dependency of updating data elements upon object retrieval.The
    ``OsidManager`` should be used to test if updates are available and
    determine what ``PropertyTypes`` are supported. The ``OsidManager``
    is also used to create the appropriate ``OsidSession`` for object
    creation, updates and deletes.

    All ``OsidObjects`` are identified by an immutable ``Id``. An ``Id``
    is assigned to an object upon creation of the object and cannot be
    changed once assigned.

    An ``OsidObject`` may support one or more supplementary records
    which are expressed in the form of interfaces. Each record interface
    is identified by a Type. A record interface may extend another
    record interface where support of the parent record interface is
    implied. In this case of interface inheritance, support of the
    parent record type may be implied through ``has_record_type()`` and
    not explicit in ``getRecordTypes()``.

    For example, if recordB extends recordA, typeB is a child of typeA.
    If a record implements typeB, than it also implements typeA. An
    application that only knows about typeA retrieves recordA. An
    application that knows about typeB, retrieves recordB which is the
    union of methods specified in typeA and typeB. If an application
    requests typeA, it may not attempt to access methods defined in
    typeB as they may not exist until explicitly requested. The
    mechanics of this polymorphism is defined by the language binder.
    One mechanism might be the use of casting.

    In addition to the record ``Types,`` OSID Objects also have a genus
    ``Type``. A genus ``Type`` indicates a classification or kind of the
    object where an "is a" relationship exists. The purpose of of the
    genus ``Type`` is to avoid the creation of unnecessary record types
    that may needlessly complicate an interface hierarchy or introduce
    interoperability issues. For example, an OSID object may have a
    record ``Type`` of ``Publication`` that defines methods pertinent to
    publications, such as an ISBN number. A provider may wish to
    distinguish between books and journals without having the need of
    new record interfaces. In this case, the genus ``Type`` may be one
    of ``Book`` or ``Journal``. While this distinction can aid a search,
    these genres should be treated in such a way that do not introduce
    interoperability problems.

    Like record Types, the genus Types may also exist in an implicit
    type hierarchy. An OSID object always has at least one genus. Genus
    types should not be confused with subject tagging, which is managed
    externally to the object. Unlike record ``Types,`` an object's genus
    may be modified. However, once an object's record is created with a
    record ``Type,`` it cannot be changed.

    Methods that return values are not permitted to return nulls. If a
    value is not set, it is indicated in the ``Metadata`` of the update
    form.

    Relationships are transient. They define a date range for which they
    are in effect.

    Unlike other ``OsidObjects`` that rely on the auxiliary Journaling
    OSID to track variance over time, ``OsidRelationships`` introduce a
    different concept of time independent from journaling. For example,
    in the present, a student was registered in a course and dropped it.
    The relationship between the student and the course remains
    pertinent, independent of any journaled changes that may have
    occurred to either the student or the course.

    Once the student has dropped the course, the relationship has
    expired such that ``is_effective()`` becomes false. It can be
    inferred that during the period of the effective dates, the student
    was actively registered in the course. Here is an example:

      * T1. September 1: Student registers for course for grades
      * T2. September 10: Student drops course
      * T3. September 15: Student re-registers for course pass/fail


    The relationships are:
      T1. R1 {effective,   September 1  -> end of term,  data=grades}
      T2. R1 {ineffective, September 1  -> September 10, data=grades}
      T3. R1 {ineffective, September 1  -> September 10, data=grades}
          R2 {effective,   September 10 -> end of term,  data=p/f}



    An OSID Provider may also permit dates to be set in the future in
    which case the relationship can become automatically become
    effective at a future time and later expire. More complex
    effectiveness management can be done through other rule-based
    services.

    Often, the selection of an ``OsidCatalog`` in instantiating an

    The flexibility of interpretation together with its central role in

    In the case where an ``OsidEnabler`` may cause a discontinuity in a

    """``OsidCompendium`` is the top level interface for reports based on measurements, calculations, summaries, or views of transactional activity within periods of time.

    This time dimension of this report may align with managed time
    periods, specific dates, or both. Oh my.

    Reports are often derived dynamically based on an examination of
    data managed elsewhere in an OSID. Reports may also be directly
    managed outside where it is desirable to capture summaries without
    the detail of the implied evaluated data. The behavior of a direct
    create or update of a report is not specified but is not limited to
    an override or a cascading update of underlying data.

    The start and end date represents the date range used in the
    evaluation of the transactional data on which this report is based.
    The start and end date may be the same indicating that the
    evaluation occurred at a point in time rather than across a date
    range. The start and end date requested may differ from the start
    and end date indicated in this report because of the inability to
    interpolate or extrapolate the date. These dates should be examined
    to understand what actually occurred and to what dates the
    information in this report pertains.

    These dates differ from the dates the report itself was requested,
    created, or modified. The dates refer to the context of the
    evaluation. In a managed report, the dates are simply the dates to
    which the report information pertains. The history of a single
    report may be examined in the Journaling OSID.

    For example, the Location of a Resource at 12:11pm is reported to be
    in Longwood and at 12:23pm is reported to be at Chestnut Hill. A
    request of a ``ResourceLocation``. A data correction may update the
    Longwood time to be 12:09pm. The update of the ``ResourceLocation``
    from 12:11pm to 12:09pm may be examined in the Journaling OSID while
    the 12:11pm time would not longer be visible in current versions of
    this report.

    Reports may be indexed by a managed time period such as a ``Term``
    or ``FiscalPeriod``. The evaluation dates may map to the opening and
    closing dates of the time period. Evaluation dates that differ from
    the time period may indicate that the transactional data is
    incomplete for that time period or that the report was calculated
    using a requested date range.

    ``OsidCompendiums`` are subjugates to other ``OsidObjects`` in that
    what is reported is tied to an instance of a dimension such as a
    person, account, or an ``OsidCatalog`` .

class OsidForm:
    """The ``OsidForm`` is the vehicle used to create and update objects.

    The form is a container for data to be sent to an update or create
    method of a session. Applications should persist their own data
    until a form is successfully submitted in an update or create
    transaction.

    The form may provide some feedback as to the validity of certain
    data updates before the update transaction is issued to the
    correspodning session but a successful modification of the form is
    not a guarantee of success for the update transaction. A consumer
    may elect to perform all updates within a single update transaction
    or break up a large update intio smaller units. The tradeoff is the
    granularity of error feedback vs. the performance gain of a single
    transaction.

    ``OsidForms`` are ``Identifiable``. The ``Id`` of the ``OsidForm``
    is used to uniquely identify the update or create transaction and
    not that of the object being updated. Currently, it is not necessary
    to have these ``Ids`` persisted.

    As with all aspects of the OSIDs, nulls cannot be used. Methods to
    clear values are also defined in the form.

    A new ``OsidForm`` should be acquired for each transaction upon an
    ``OsidObject``. Forms should not be reused from one object to
    another even if the supplied data is the same as the forms may
    encapsulate data specific to the object requested. Example of
    changing a display name and a color defined in a color interface
    extension:
      ObjectForm form = session.getObjectFormForUpdate(objectId);
      form.setDisplayName("new name");

    """The ``OsidObjectForm`` is used to create and update ``OsidObjects``.

    The form is not an ``OsidObject`` but merely a container for data to
    be sent to an update or create method of a session. A provider may
    or may not combine the ``OsidObject`` and ``OsidObjectForm``
    interfaces into a single object.

    Generally, a set method parallels each get method of an
    ``OsidObject``. Additionally, ``Metadata`` may be examined for each
    data element to assist in understanding particular rules concerning
    acceptable data.

    The form may provide some feedback as to the validity of certain
    data updates before the update transaction is issued to the
    correspodning session but a successful modification of the form is
    not a guarantee of success for the update transaction. A consumer
    may elect to perform all updates within a single update transaction
    or break up a large update intio smaller units. The tradeoff is the
    granularity of error feedback vs. the performance gain of a single
    transaction.

    As with all aspects of the OSIDs, nulls cannot be used. Methods to
    clear values are also defined in the form.

    A new ``OsidForm`` should be acquired for each transaction upon an
    ``OsidObject``. Forms should not be reused from one object to
    another even if the supplied data is the same as the forms may
    encapsulate data specific to the object requested. Example of
    changing a display name and a color defined in a color interface
    extension:
      ObjectForm form = session.getObjectFormForUpdate(objectId);
      form.setDisplayName("new name");
      ColorForm recordForm = form.getFormRecord(colorRecordType);
      recordForm.setColor("green");
