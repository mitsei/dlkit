class AgentLookupSession:
    """This session provides methods for retrieving ``Agent`` objects.

    The ``Agent`` represents the authenticated entity. Agents generally
    map to resources although this isn't always the case.

    This session defines two sets of views which offer differing
    behaviors when retrieving multiple objects.

      * comparative view: elements may be silently omitted or re-ordered
      * plenary view: provides a complete and ordered result set or is
        an error condition
      * isolated agency view: All agent methods in this session operate,
        retrieve and pertain to agents defined explicitly in the current
        agency. Using an isolated view is useful for managing agents
        with the AgentAdminSession.
      * federated agency view: All agent methods in this session
        operate, retrieve and pertain to all agents defined in this
        agency and any other agents implicitly available in this agency
        through agency inheritence.


    Generally, the comparative view should be used for most applications
    as it permits operation even if there a particular element is
    inaccessible. For example, a hierarchy output can be plugged into a
    lookup method to retrieve all objects known to a hierarchy, but it
    may not be necessary to break execution if a node from the hierarchy
    no longer exists. However, some administrative applications may need
    to know whether it had retrieved an entire set of objects and may
    sacrifice some interoperability for the sake of precision.

    Agents may have an additional records indicated by their respective
    record types. The record may not be accessed through a cast of the
    ``Agent``.
