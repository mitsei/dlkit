    form object. ``OsidForms`` are requested for each create or update
    and may not be reused.

    Create and update operations differ in their usage. To create a
    ``Qualifier,`` a ``QualifierForm`` is requested using
    ``get_qualifier_form_for_create()`` specifying the desired
    relationship peers and record ``Types`` or none if no record
    ``Types`` are needed. The returned ``QualifierForm`` will indicate
    that it is to be used with a create operation and can be used to
    examine metdata or validate data prior to creation. Once the
    ``QualifierForm`` is submiited to a create operation, it cannot be
    reused with another create operation unless the first operation was
    unsuccessful. Each ``QualifierForm`` corresponds to an attempted
    transaction.

    For updates, ``QualifierForms`` are requested to the ``Qualifier``
    ``Id`` that is to be updated using ``getQualifierFormForUpdate()``.
    Similarly, the ``QualifierForm`` has metadata about the data that
    can be updated and it can perform validation before submitting the
    update. The ``QualifierForm`` can only be used once for a successful
    update and cannot be reused.

    The delete operations delete ``Qualifiers``. To unmap a
    ``Qualifier`` from the current ``Vault,`` the
    ``QualifierVaultAssignmentSession`` should be used. These delete
    operations attempt to remove the ``Qualifier`` itself thus removing
    it from all known ``Vault`` catalogs.

    This session includes an ``Id`` aliasing mechanism to assign an
    external ``Id`` to an internally assigned Id.
