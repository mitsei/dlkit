    ``Assessment Items`` are accessed via the ``Question`` interface. A

        available after the previous item was submitted or skipped.
      * asynchronous response: Questions may be accessed independently
        of response submission.


    It may be the case that it is allowed to suspend and resume an
    assessment. ``can_suspend()`` indicates the availability of this
    feature. ``finished()`` indicates the assessment is complete.

    This session is used in the context of an ``AssessmentSection``. An

        There are two methods for retrieving questions. One is using the

        methods. In synchronous mode, ``has_next_question()`` is

        ``Questions`` may also be accessed via a ``QuestionList``. If
        syncronous responses are required, ``QuestionList.available() ==
        0`` and ``QuestionList.getNextQuestion()`` blocks until the

    operation, it cannot be reused with another create operation unless
    the first operation was unsuccessful. Each ``ItemForm`` corresponds
    to an attempted transaction.

    cannot be reused.

    This session defines views that offer differing behaviors for
    searching.

      * federated bank view: searches include assessments offered in
        banks of which this bank is an ancestor in the bank hierarchy
      * isolated bank view: searches are restricted to assessments
        offered in this bank


    Assessments offered may have a query record indicated by their
    respective record types. The query record is accessed via the
    ``AssessmentOfferedQuery``.

    The data for create and update is provided by the consumer via the
    form object. ``OsidForms`` are requested for each create or update
    and may not be reused.

    Create and update operations differ in their usage. To create an
    ``AssessmentOffered,`` an ``AssessmentOfferedForm`` is requested
    using ``get_assessment_offered_form_for_create()`` specifying the
    assessment and desired record ``Types`` or none if no record
    ``Types`` are needed. The returned ``AssessmentOfferedForm`` will
    indicate that it is to be used with a create operation and can be
    used to examine metdata or validate data prior to creation. Once the
    ``AssessmentOfferedForm`` is submiited to a create operation, it
    cannot be reused with another create operation unless the first
    operation was unsuccessful. Each ``AssessmentOfferedForm``
    corresponds to an attempted transaction.

    For updates, ``AssessmentOfferedForms`` are requested to the
    ``AssessmentOffered``  ``Id`` that is to be updated using
    ``getAssessmentOfferedFormForUpdate()``. Similarly, the
    ``AssessmentOfferedForm`` has metadata about the data that can be
    updated and it can perform validation before submitting the update.
    The ``AssessmentOfferedForm`` can only be used once for a successful
    update and cannot be reused.

    The delete operations delete ``AssessmentsOffered``. To unmap an
    ``AssessmentOffered`` from the current ``Bank,`` the
    ``AssessmentOfferedBankAssignmentSession`` should be used. These
    delete operations attempt to remove the ``AssessmentOffered`` itself
    thus removing it from all known ``Bank`` catalogs.

    external ``Id`` to an internally assigned Id.
