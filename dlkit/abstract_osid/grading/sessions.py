    ``GradeEntryForm`` will indicate that it is to be used with a create
    operation and can be used to examine metdata or validate data prior
    to creation. Once the ``GradeEntryForm`` is submiited to a create
    operation, it cannot be reused with another create operation unless
    the first operation was unsuccessful. Each ``GradeEntryForm``
    corresponds to an attempted transaction.

    For updates, ``GradeEntryForms`` are requested to the ``GradeEntry``
    ``Id`` that is to be updated using ``getGradeEntryFormForUpdate()``.
    Similarly, the ``GradeEntryForm`` has metadata about the data that
    can be updated and it can perform validation before submitting the
    update. The ``GradeEntryForm`` can only be used once for a
    successful update and cannot be reused.

    The delete operations delete ``GradeEntries``. To unmap a
    ``GradeEntry`` from the current ``Gradebook,`` the
    ``GradeEntryGradebookAssignmentSession`` should be used. These
    delete operations attempt to remove the ``GradeEntry`` itself thus
    removing it from all known ``Gradebook`` catalogs.

    This session includes an ``Id`` aliasing mechanism to assign an
    external ``Id`` to an internally assigned Id.

    The data for create and update is provided by the consumer via the

    and may not be reused.

    Create and update operations differ in their usage. To create a
    ``GradebookColumn,`` a ``GradebookColumnForm`` is requested using
    ``get_gradebook_column_form_for_create()`` specifying the desired
    record ``Types`` or none if no record ``Types`` are needed. The

    validate data prior to creation. Once the ``GradebookColumnForm`` is
    submiited to a create operation, it cannot be reused with another
    create operation unless the first operation was unsuccessful. Each
    ``GradebookColumnForm`` corresponds to an attempted transaction.

    For updates, ``GradebookColumnForms`` are requested to the
    ``GradebookColumn``  ``Id`` that is to be updated using
    ``getGradebookColumnFormForUpdate()``. Similarly, the
    ``GradebookColumnForm`` has metadata about the data that can be
    updated and it can perform validation before submitting the update.
    The ``GradebookColumnForm`` can only be used once for a successful
    update and cannot be reused.

    ``GradebookColumn`` from the current ``Gradebook,`` the
    ``GradebookColumnGradebookAssignmentSession`` should be used. These
